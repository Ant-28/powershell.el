PowerShell Mode
===============


PowerShell Mode is an Emacs major mode for editing and running
Microsoft PowerShell files.

History
-------

I combined
[powershell.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Powershell.el) and
[powershell-mode.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PowerShell-Mode.el)
(last updated October 2012).  I used the name powershell.el with the
permission of the creator, Dino Chiesa.  Since powershell.el was
licensed with the new BSD license I combined the two files using the
more restrictive license, the GPL.  I also cleaned up the
documentation and reorganized some of the code.
